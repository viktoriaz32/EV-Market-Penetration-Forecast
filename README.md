# EV Market Penetration Forecast and Analysis

## Project Overview

This project simulates an electric vehicle (EV) adoption analysis for a hypothetical automotive market between 2021–2024, with a forecast extending to 2028.
It was designed to demonstrate advanced Excel analytics, forecasting, and dashboard design.

The analysis models how price, marketing spend, rebates, and charging infrastructure influence EV adoption over time.
It includes full time-series forecasting, scenario testing, and KPI reporting built natively in Excel.

## Objectives

- Analyze historical EV adoption data (2021–2024)
- Identify market drivers (price, incentives, chargers, marketing)
- Forecast adoption trends for 2025–2028 using Excel’s ETS algorithm
- Simulate optimistic / pessimistic market scenarios
- Visualize results in a professional KPI dashboard
